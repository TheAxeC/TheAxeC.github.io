This is my GitHub user page made with Jekyll and Bootstrap. The website functions as both a blog and a resume.

The website contains an overview of the projects I have made and my academic record. Occasionally I also blog about my experiences as a grad student at KULeuven.

## Editing

Adding new content can be done by only changing:

Publications are added into their respective folder:

Other:
