## theaxec.Github.com

This is my GitHub user page made with Jekyll and Bootstrap. The website functions as both a blog and a resume.

The website contains an overview of the projects I have made and my academic record. Occasionally I also blog about my experiences as a grad student at KULeuven.

The script `add_static_plugin.sh` is used to copy the generated files from the plugins to the root directory.
This is required since Github does not run these plugins.
