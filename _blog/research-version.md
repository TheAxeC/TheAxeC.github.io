### Research Vision for Axel Faes

**Vision Statement**

My research vision is to pioneer the development of advanced neurotechnology solutions that bridge the gap between neural activity and real-world applications. I envision a future where brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are seamlessly integrated into daily life, offering unprecedented levels of control and interaction for individuals with disabilities and enhancing human-computer interaction for all.

### Key Areas of Focus

1. **Innovative Neural Decoding Algorithms**

   My research will continue to push the boundaries of neural decoding by developing sophisticated algorithms that can accurately interpret and predict neural signals. Leveraging multiway and tensor-based methods, I aim to capture the complex, multilinear relationships inherent in brain activity. By integrating advanced machine learning techniques, such as deep learning and recursive tensor decomposition, I seek to enhance the precision and reliability of BCIs.

2. **Real-time Applications and Clinical Integration**

   A primary goal of my research is to translate theoretical advancements into practical, real-time applications. This involves optimizing algorithms to reduce training times and computational demands, making them viable for clinical settings. I envision BCIs that can be rapidly deployed in neurorehabilitation, enabling stroke patients and amputees to regain motor functions through intuitive and responsive neural interfaces.

3. **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**

   Recognizing the multidisciplinary nature of neurotechnology, my research will foster collaboration across neuroscience, engineering, computer science, and clinical disciplines. By working closely with clinicians, engineers, and fellow researchers, I aim to ensure that our technological innovations meet real-world needs and are grounded in a deep understanding of neural physiology.

4. **Ethical and Accessible Neurotechnology**

   As we develop more advanced BCIs, it is crucial to address the ethical implications and ensure these technologies are accessible to a wide range of users. My vision includes advocating for responsible research practices, equitable access to neurotechnology, and engaging with diverse communities to understand their needs and perspectives. This approach ensures that the benefits of BCIs are distributed fairly and ethically.

5. **Educational Outreach and Knowledge Dissemination**

   Committed to the dissemination of knowledge, I will continue to publish my findings in leading journals and conferences, and develop open-source tools and frameworks that can be used by researchers and practitioners worldwide. By mentoring students and conducting workshops, I aim to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers to explore the exciting field of neural interfaces and neurotechnology.

### Long-term Goals

- **Seamless Integration of BCIs**: Develop BCIs that offer intuitive and seamless control of prosthetics and assistive devices, significantly improving the quality of life for individuals with motor impairments.
- **Comprehensive Understanding of Neural Mechanisms**: Achieve a deeper understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying motor control and cognitive functions, contributing to both basic neuroscience and applied neuroengineering.
- **Scalable and Efficient Neurotechnology Solutions**: Create scalable solutions that can be easily adapted to various clinical and non-clinical environments, ensuring that neurotechnology benefits are widely accessible.

Through these efforts, I aim to lead pioneering research that transforms our understanding of brain function and translates these insights into practical technologies that enhance human capabilities and well-being.
