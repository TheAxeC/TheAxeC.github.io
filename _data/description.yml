  I am a Computer Science Engineering student at the KULeuven. Currently, I'm pursuing two Master's degrees. My specialisation in my Computer Science Master's degree is Artificial Intelligence and Theoretical Computer Science. In my Artificial Intelligence Master's degree, I'm focussing on Mathematical Engineering and Neural Computing. I am participating in the Honoursprogramme of the Faculty of Engineering Science (research track) at KULeuven.
  I am also a big supporter of the open source community.
