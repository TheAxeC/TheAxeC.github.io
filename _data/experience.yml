      Faculty of Engineering Science: Computer Science
      Research group: DTAI
      Part of the Honoursprogramme of the Faculty of Engineering Science (research track).  My project is part of the C1 project: Algebraic Effect Handlers: Harnessing the Fundamental Power of Effects. Eff is a functional programming language that uses handlers to handle all kinds of effects. These effects could be I/O, exceptions, user-defined, etc. My task is to design, implement, benchmark and formally proof new optimisations in the Eff compiler. The compiler is written in OCaml.

      I worked on the iMinds PRO-FLOW project.
      My work involved creating multiple usecases to measure website performance. The main focus is on the difference between the http versions (http1.1, https, http2).
      During the project, I had to utilise multiple servers, maintain and extend the nodejs framework used to measure website performance, and manually optimize commercial websites using PHP, JS, HTML and CSS.

      Work on a project which focuses on the interaction between a human entity and a drone, aswell as interaction between the drone and virtual objects. This project is written in C++, used the Optitrack motion capture and a custom created drone.
