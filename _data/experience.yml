    about: "Faculty of Engineering Science: Computer Science <br/>
            Research group: DTAI <br/>
            Part of the Honoursprogramme of the Faculty of Engineering Science (research track). <br/> My project is part of the C1 project: Algebraic Effect Handlers: Harnessing the Fundamental Power of Effects. Eff is a functional programming language that uses handlers to handle all kinds of effects. These effects could be I/O, exceptions, user-defined, etc. My task is to design, implement, benchmark and formally proof new optimisations in the Eff compiler. The compiler is written in OCaml."

    about: "I work on the iMinds PRO-FLOW project. <br/>
  	My work involved creating multiple usecases to measure website performance. The main focus is on the difference between the http versions (http1.1, https, http2).
  	During the project, I had to utilise multiple servers, maintain and extend the nodejs framework used to measure website performance, and manually optimize commercial websites using PHP, JS, HTML and CSS."
