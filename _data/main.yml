    I am a Msc. Artificial Intelligence and Msc. Computer Science Engineering student at KULeuven. My main interests include program optimization, numerical linear algebra, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, neural computing and brain-computer interfaces. I am participating in the Honoursprogramme of the Faculty of Engineering Science (research track) at KULeuven. I am also a big supporter of Open Source Software.
