    I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Biomedical Data Sciences research group at UHasselt, Belgium, and the Scientific Coordinator of the Flanders AI Research Program, focusing on the Use Case Real World Evidence. My current work centers on applying machine learning techniques to cardiovascular data. Additionally, I am affiliated with the Biomedical Research Institute (BIOMED) and the Data Science Institute (DSI) at UHasselt.
    
    My research interests include biomedical data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, with a focus on developing innovative methods for analyzing and interpreting complex health data. I am passionate about leveraging data-driven approaches to improve patient outcomes and advance the field of precision medicine. By combining expertise in data science, engineering, and medicine, I aim to bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical applications, ultimately contributing to the development of more effective and personalized healthcare solutions.

    **Vision for Research Impact**
    At the intersection of neuroscience, machine learning, and computational engineering, my mission is to advance the understanding and application of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and neural decoding. By developing innovative computational methods and optimizing algorithms for real-time applications, I aim to enhance the efficacy and accessibility of neurotechnology solutions. Through my research, I strive to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and practical implementations, ultimately contributing to improved outcomes in neurorehabilitation and prosthetic control. Collaboration, rigorous experimentation, and a commitment to scientific excellence drive my efforts to push the boundaries of what is possible in neural interfacing and cognitive engineering.
