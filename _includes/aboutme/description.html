I am a Computer Science Engineering student at the KULeuven. My specialisation in my Master's degree is Artificial Intelligence and Theoretical Computer Science. My main interests include programming languages, distributed systems and artificial intelligence.
I am participating in the Honoursprogramme of the Faculty of Engineering Science (research track) at KULeuven.
I am also a big supporter of open source software.
A lot of the projects I made are available on Github.
